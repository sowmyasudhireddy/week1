NODE.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment.
The Node run-time environment includes everything we need to execute a program written in JavaScript.
Node.js came into existence when the original developers of JavaScript extended it from running in the browser to something you could run on your machine as a standalone application.

WHY?
->Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
->Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
->Node.js’ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
->it is very fast 
        running of the program is very fast because it uses v8 engine and non blocking code.
->node js encourages sharing
        Node.js encourages sharing with the presence of the Node Package Manager or NPM. It includes the repository of 50,000 packages, which helps developers to create effective solutions.
->good fit for real time applications
          Node.js has extraordinary features when it comes to developing real-time applications such as chats and gaming apps.which uses event driven and non blocking servers.
          ex:-  pay pal,linkedin,ebay etc
->node js serves as proxy server.
->effective single code base
        Node.js is now proving its worth as a game-changing technology as developers are able to write JavaScript server-side and client-side coding.
        And thus, it becomes easy to send and synchronize the data between these two points automatically, helping developers to save time.
