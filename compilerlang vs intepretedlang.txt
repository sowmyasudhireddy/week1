Advantages of compiled landuages over interpreted languages:

Programming languages generally fall into one of two categories: Compiled or Interpreted.

->With a compiled language, code you enter is reduced to a set of machine-specific instructions before being saved as an executable file.
-> With interpreted languages, the code is saved in the same format that you entered. 

->Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted ones because interpreted programs must be reduced to machine instructions at runtime.because compilation is done before execution
   whereas in interpreted languages both compilation and execution done at a time.
Examples:
compiler languages     : c,c++.
interpreted languages  : PERL,python,MATLab.
