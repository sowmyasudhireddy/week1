#RAM:

->RAM (Random Access Memory) is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result. 
It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.

->Data in the RAM can be accessed randomly but it is very expensive.

->RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence, a backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with computers. 

RAM is of two types :-

Static RAM (SRAM)
Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

SRAM:

->The word static indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied. However, data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature

Charecteristics of SRAM:

Long life
Faster
Used as cache memory
Large size
Expensive
High power consumption

DRAM:

->DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually refreshed in order to maintain the data. 
This is done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. DRAM is used for most system memory as it is cheap and small.

Charecteristics of DRAM:

Short data lifetime
Slower as compared to SRAM
Smaller in size
Less expensive
Less power consumption
