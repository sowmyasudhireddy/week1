SINGLR THREAD AND MULTI THREAD:

->That means that a thread is a simple flow of instruction.
->An application can be single thread and multi thread

 single threaded : it as a single line going from the entry point of the application to its end(single connection).
 
 multi-threaded:  (imagine a tree) the whole app starts from 1 point, than it branches out more and more(multiple connections).

->Some connections cannot achieve full speed from a single connection, or have very unstable speeds, and multiple connections allow us to "fill" the available bandwidth more easily.
