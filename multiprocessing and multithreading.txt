MULTIPROCESSING:

->A multiprocessing system is one which has more than two processors. 
->The CPUs are added to the system to increase the computing speed of the system. 
->Each CPU has its own set of registers and main memory.
->Multiprocessing can be classified as :
1.symmetric multiprocessing 
2.asymmetric multiprocessing.

->In symmetric multiprocessing, all processors are free to run any process in a system.

-> In Asymmetric multiprocessing, there is a master-slave relationship among the processors. The master processor is responsible for allotting the process to slave processors.

MULTITHREADING:

->Multithreading is the execution of multiple threads of a single process concurrently within the context of that process.
-> A thread of a process means a code segment of a process, which has its own thread ID, program counter, registers and stack and can execute independently. 
But threads belonging to the same process has to share the belongings of that process like code, data, and system resources.

->to understand multi threading claerly let us consider an example:

->A word processor, displays graphic, responds to keystrokes, and at the same time, it continues spelling and grammar checking.
 You do not have to open different word processors to do this concurrently. It does get happen in a single word processor with the help of multiple threads.
