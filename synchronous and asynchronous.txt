SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS

->Synchronous way: It waits for each operation to complete, after that only it executes the next operation. 
For your query: The console.log() command will not be executed until & unless the query has finished executing to get all the result from Database.

example:Atom,SOL..etc

->Asynchronous way: It never waits for each operation to complete, rather it executes all operations parellelly. 
The result of each operation will be handled once the result is available.
 For your query: The console.log() command will be executed soon after the Database.Query() method. While the Database query runs in the background and loads the result once it is finished retrieving the data.

example: Nodejs,java,python,GOlang...etc
